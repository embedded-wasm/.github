# Webassembly for Embedded Devices

A project to support WASM on embedded devices, encompassing a [WASI/WITX and interface specifications](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/spec), [C/wasm3](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/rt_wasm3) and [Rust/wasmtime](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/spec) runtimes, and environments for [linux](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/rt) as well as deeply embedded platforms such as the ESP32 and [NRF52](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/embedded-wasm-nrf52).

Please remember everything here is a work in progress. If you'd like to learn more (or play around with the existing applications) check out the [book](https://embedded-wasm.github.io/book/), and if you'd like to get involved there's plenty of work to do! Have a look around for open [issues](https://github.com/orgs/embedded-wasm/projects/2) or join us in the [chat](https://app.element.io/index.html#/room/#wasm-embedded:matrix.org) ^_^
